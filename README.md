We will not say no if you ask, it's just courtesy.

# How-To
If you would like to try the most experimental version, which is the most up-to-date, do the following

### Windows:

1. Download GithubForWindows, or installed the Git Shell/Bash for Windows. 

Once installed/setup, you should run this command in the git shell before cloning
	
	git config --global core.autocrlf false
	
Otherwise it will not flash properly and you will need to add this command, delete the repo, and clone again

2. Clone the master branch to your computer.
3. Run the build.bat found in the folder. Do this by double clicking the .bat file
4. Copy the created .zip file to your phone and flash

### Linux:

1. Install git, by typeing into a terminal 

```shell
	sudo apt-get install git-core
```

Or whatever is similar for your distro

2. Clone the master branch to your computer.
3. Run the build.sh in a terminal window
4. Copy the created .zip file to your phone and flash

# Using the master branch

If you do this, bare in mind, it may not work, there may be problems. You can let me know about any issues you think we haven't noticed at XDA.
